# Machine-Learning-Quant-Trading

Final Project for Machine Learning (Math 156 at UCLA during Winter 2024):

This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), in predicting stock market to maximize trading profits. We take a deep-dive into RL learning background, related theories, as well as relevant methodology and algorithms. We then set up different DQN and PPO models, incorporating features like transaction costs and initial account balances to simulate a more realistic trading environment. Tests and evaluations have been applied to three stocks with different volatility, including Apple Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., and Tesla Inc., after which we’ve compared the results through graphical visualizations, providing both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We’ve discussed briefly the contribution, limitation, and possible future work for RL on stock trading in the end.
